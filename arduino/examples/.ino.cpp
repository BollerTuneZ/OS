#error the file: i2c_master.ino is not found in the indexer though it exists on the file system.
#error this is probably due to a bad eclipse configuration : ino and pde are not marked as c++ file.
#error please check whether *.ino and *.pde are marked as C++ source code in windows->preferences->C/C++->file types.
