Raspi PWM is part of the [Raspi.js suite](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi) that provides access to the hardware PWM on pin 12 (GPIO18).

If you have a bug report, feature request, or wish to contribute code, please be sure to check out the [Contributing Guide](blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

First, be sure that you have installed [raspi](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi).

Install with NPM:

```Shell
npm install raspi-pwm
```

**Warning**: this module requires GCC 4.8 or newer. This means that you should be running Raspbian Jessie or newer, released in September of 2015.

## Example Usage

```JavaScript
var raspi = require('raspi');
var PWM = require('raspi-pwm').PWM;

raspi.init(function() {
  var pwm = new PWM();
  pwm.write(72); // Center a servo
});
```

## Pin Naming

The pins on the Raspberry Pi are a little complicated. There are multiple headers on some Raspberry Pis with extra pins, and the pin numbers are not consistent between Raspberry Pi board versions.

To help make it easier, you can specify pins in three ways. The first is to specify the pin by function, e.g. ```'GPIO18'```. The second way is to specify by pin number, which is specified in the form "P[header]-[pin]", e.g. ```'P1-7'```. The final way is specify the [Wiring Pi virtual pin number](http://wiringpi.com/pins/), e.g. ```7```. If you specify a number instead of a string, it is assumed to be a Wiring Pi number.

Be sure to read the [full list of pins](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/wiki/Pin-Information) on the supported models of the Raspberry Pi.


## API

### new PWM(config)

Instantiates a new PWM instance on the given pin. Note that PWM is limited to only 1 pin on the Model A/B and 2 pins on the A+/B+/2/Zero. On the A/B, the PWM pin is exposed on ```GPIO18```. The A+/B+/2 is a little more complicated. The first PWM is exposed on two pins, ```GPIO18``` and ```GPIO12```. This PWM can only be active on one of these pins at a time, however, so choose carefully. The second PWM pin on the A+/B+/2/Zero is exposed on ```GPIO19```. Check the [wiring information wiki](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/wiki) for more information.

    <td>The configuration for the PWM pin. If the config is a number or string, it is assumed to be the pin number for the peripheral. If it is an object, the following properties are supported:</td>

          <td>Number</td>
          <td>Sets the clock divisor register in the PWM peripheral. This value controls how long each clock cycle is. This value is a divisor, i.e. higher values mean lower clock speeds. Use in conjunction with the range property to set the period.</td>

### Instance Properties

#### range

A number representing the range initialization value. If a value for `range` was passed to the constructor, it is reflected back here. If no value for `range` was passed to the constructor, then this reflects the default range value, currently 1000.

#### clockDivisor

A number representing the clock divisor initialization value. If a value for `clockDivisor` was passed to the constructor, it is reflected back here. If no value for `clockDivisor` was passed to the constructor, then this reflects the default range value, currently 400.

### Instance Methods

#### write(value)

Sets the duty cycle for the PWM output. The period is 20ms.

_Arguments_:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>value</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>The duty cycle for the PWM to set, must be between 0 and 1024</td>
  </tr>
</table>

_Returns_: None

Note: The PWM does not start outputting a signal until write is called for the first time.
